<p>A web framework is a software tool that developers use to create web applications more efficiently. It provides a collection of libraries and tools for managing different aspects of web development, including handling HTTP requests, managing databases, and rendering HTML templates. The framework simplifies the process of building a web application by providing a set of standardized approaches and best practices, enabling developers to focus on the unique aspects of their application.</p>
<p>Web frameworks are available in many programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. Some popular examples of web frameworks include Django and Flask for Python, Ruby on Rails for Ruby, and Express.js for JavaScript. These frameworks provide different levels of abstraction and functionality, from full-stack frameworks that handle everything from the front-end to the back-end, to micro-frameworks that only provide the bare essentials for building a web application. The choice of a framework depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements of the project.</p>
